# Name Generator

This is a command line name generator. 
Don't let big corporations have all the fun with their food and zoo based 
algo names, now you can generate your own.

Please refer to the Laravel documentation for installation if you are not familiar with Laravel. 

Using the artisan console:

    php artisan namegen {nameset}

As a shell script:
    
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/namegen ~/namegen/install/folder/storage/bin/namegen.sh

    namegen {nameset}


Notes: I am planning the api but need something quick for now so it is cli only.
