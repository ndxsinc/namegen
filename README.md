# Name Generator

This is a command line name generator. 
Don't let big corporations have all the fun with their food and zoo based 
algo names, now you can generate your own.

Using the artisan console:

    php artisan namegen {nameset}

As a shell script:
    
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/namegen ~/namegen/install/folder/storage/bin/namegen.sh

    namegen {nameset}


Notes: i am planning the api but need something quick for now so it is cli only.
